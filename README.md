## Development and building

#### Getting started

To start, download and install the package manager for nodejs `npm`. This is
used to download and install dependencies used to compile vue files. These
dependencies can be downloaded and installed using

	npm install
    

### Development

To build and run for development use the following:

	npm run dev
    
This will host the application at `localhost:8080`

### Deployment

To build for production, use the following command:

	npm run build
    
The above command also features minification to help reduce file size
