# Vue Snippets

Vue components with simple designs yet powerful features.

## Disclaimer

Some (or the majority) components aren't build to be used in external projects, but you can adapt them for your own use 

___if you want help to decouple a component, open an issue and I will be glad to help =)___

The components don't use a same pattern, every component are unique, with different props, validation, template, etc.
